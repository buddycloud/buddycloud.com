<p class="lead">Quickly add secure and scalable communication to your app or website.</p>
	<h2>Scalable</h2>
	<p>Scaling your service because it's popular is a 'good problem to
		have'. And it needs a good roadmap: so we have designed Buddycloud to
		grow with you and scale up without bottlenecks. Buddycloud is
		currently tested against servers that scale to over 10M simultaneous
		users. Additionally, each server can subsequently be scaled
		horizontally to support more simultaneous users.</p>
	<p>Buddycloud also works with commercial realtime CDNs like
		fanout.io which help you offload capacity to a Global push CDN.</p>
	<h2>Rich Communications</h2>
	<p>Move beyond just text sharing: Buddycloud enables you to share
		media files with just one channel or with the entire world. And to
		make development easy, the Buddycloud API will return scaled
		thumbnails for easy embedded into your application.</p>
	<p>Our rich communication roadmap includes adding full webRTC video
		calling between Buddycloud channels.</p>
	<h2>By developers, for developers</h2>
	<p>Buddycloud is designed make adding communication to web and app
		development as simple as possible by offloading as much of the tricky
		application logic to the server. This means you can quickly write
		reliable, services by just using the existing Buddycloud libraries.</p>
	<p>The Buddycloud platform follows a convention over configuration
		approach that helps you quickly build without pre-configuration.

	<h2>Open source and open standards</h2>
	<p>Secure communication needs open, inspectable secure
		communications come from publishing code as open source. Buddycloud's
		code is maintained on Github and released under the Apache 2.0
		license. Buddycloud builds on existing standards like ActivityStrea.ms
		and the ATOM syndication format: you benefit from being able to reuse
		a wide range of existing libraries.</p>
	<p>Buddycloud works closely with the W3C, Mozilla Foundation, and
		XSF to build the strong foundation for an open communication
		ecosystem.</p>
	<h2>Secure by design.</h2>
	<p>Buddycloud is used by security-sensitive agencies to protoct
		their communications.</p>
	<p>Buddycloud's modular design means that components communicate in
		their own security space and leverage the tested XMPP communication
		security for inter-module communication.</p>
	<p>All code is peer-reviewed and extensively tested.</p>
	<p>All communication between Buddycloud servers and clients uses
		TLSv1.2 for encryption.</p>
	<p>Buddycloud uses hashed passwords</p>
	<h2>User privacy</h2>
	<p>Buddycloud enables users to set different privacy settings per
		channel. Administrators can set permissions per Buddycloud site. Users
		can select who can view their channel, make it open to just other
		members of their Buddycloud site, or open to the world.</p>
	<h2>Run it yourself or have Buddycloud host it for you.</h2>
	<p>Buddycloud comes in two compatible flavours: fully hosted and an
		install-it-yourself set of packages and instructions. Both editions
		use exactly the same code so that you have the flexibility to migrate
		your data and users between platforms by just changing the API url.</p>
	<p>We recommend you test drive Buddycloud using the existing public
		API on the hosted service before spinning up your own install. Then
		when you are ready, follow the Install Guide or Sign up for
		professional hosting.</p>
	<h2>Community and enterprise editions</h2>
	<p>The Buddycloud community edition is open source, free to
		download and run on your site. It aims to provide the best both
		worlds: rapid updates and fixes with long-term stability,
		supportability, and maintainability.</p>
	<p>The Buddycloud enterprise edition is integrated, tested, and
		Includes patches, updates, SLA-based support, multi-year maintenance
		policies.</p>
	<p>Get in touch to find our more which edition is best for your
		needs.</p>
	<h2>Extensible design</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Structured data {link to architecture page}</li>
		<li>Application nodes within a channel</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>We have working demos</h2>
	<p>{lots of screenshots}</p>
	<h2>Modular</h2>
	<p>Keep your operations lean and mean by only running the
		Buddycloud services you need. If you don't need to support media or
		push notifications, it's as simple as not installing these services.
		If you find out that you later need social recommendations, just add
		that Buddycloud component.</p>
	<h2>{link to quick start}</h2>
	<h2>Easy to use</h2>
	<p>
		As a general rule we don't want to invent an enormous system that
		takes ages to master. Buddycloud should be as easy to use as reading
		the API and getting data from endpoints like
		<code>api.example.com/testuser@myapp.com/content/posts</code>
		.
	</p>
	<h2>Lots of libraries</h2>
	<p>Buddycloud.js, xmpp-ftw or the android SDK</p>
	<p>"As a general rule we don't want to invent an enormous
		java.beans.everything class that people have to inherit from. Instead
		we'd like the JavaBeans runtimes to provide default behaviour for
		'normal' objects, but to allow objects to override a given piece of
		default behaviour by inheriting from some specific
		java.beans.something interface."</p>
	<h2>push notifications</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>email or mobile</li>
		<li>compatible with gateways like mailgun or sendgrid</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Scale Buddycloud to millions of users</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>scalable architecture</li>
		<li>scale horizontally</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>share media (unlke other services - media can be open or
		closed)</h2>
	<h2>open, open, open</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>open protocol</li>
		<li>open open code</li>
		<li>open design process</li>
		<li>community</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>secure</h2>
	<h2>features to get you started</h2>
	<p>Together with services like push notifications we've added a
		host of useful modules that will get you started. The media server
		enables sharing of small and large files in channels, the search
		engine indexes public channels.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the firehose presents a realtime feed of new content</li>
		<li>friend finder</li>
		<li>channel discovery (active channels, recommended channels)</li>
		<li>media server</li>
		<li>search engine</li>
		<li>firehose</li>
		<li>APIs and SDKs</li>
	</ul>
