	<p class="lead">Buddycloud is an ecosystem of components,
		distributed by design, and built without cutting corners.</p>

	<h2>Completely distributed design</h2>
	<p>We've designed Buddycloud so that anyone can run their own
		Buddycloud server. This means that companies and privacy aware
		individuals can maintain their own communication cloud behind the
		firewall and selectively choose what data they wish to share with
		others.</p>
	<p>

			alt="completely distributed design">
		<figcaption>Buddycloud sites find each other, connect,
			and share information.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	</p>
	<p>The old way of building communication services was to put all
		the data into a central core.</p>
	<p>Buddycloud is a revolutionary new design where anyone can run
		their own Buddycloud server, and each Buddycloud server will find,
		connect and share the data you choose with users on other Buddycloud
		servers.</p>
	<p>This approach has huge benefits, especially for industries that
		care about data privacy (Finance, Medicine).</p>

	<h3>Buddycloud uses channels</h3>
	<p>
		A channel is a collection of activity feeds and value-stores that can
		have publishers, and subscribers. Buddycloud channels can scale up to
		millions of followers or scale down to be used as an individual
		data-store. A channel looks like <em>user@example.com</em>
	</p>

			application to use.</figcaption>

	<p>channels look like</p>

		<tr>
			<th>Channel Address</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>user@example.com</td>
			<td>A user's channel</td>

		<tr>
			<td>user@other-domain.com</td>
			<td>A buddycloud channel on a remote site</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>customer-support@company.com</td>
			<td>A channel that anyone can post into and get support</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br />
	<h3>channels comprise application nodes</h3>
	<p>
		Each channel is made up of application nodes. When you follow a
		channel, for example, <em>user@example.com</em> you are really
		following a collection of application nodes. (<em>user@example.com/posts
			user@example.com/public-key user@example.com/geolocation</em> etc). Any
		updates to a node are pushed out to all followers of the channel. So
		when you want to build your application on Buddycloud you simply use
		an existing application node or create a new one for your projects
		specific needs.

	<p>Each Application node can have different stream formats,
		different metadata fields and different stream lengths (single item vs
		infinite items).</p>

	<table class="table table-striped table-condensed">
		<tr>
			<th>Channel and Application node name</th>

				<em>user@example.com</em>

	<h3>Buddycloud channels are synchronized across Buddycloud sites</h3>
	<p>
		You post data in a channel (for example <em>user@example.com/posts</em>)
		and the update is synchronised to followers on the local and remote
		Buddycloud servers. The Buddycloud server will also take care of
		"catching-up" from remote sites if it has been offline.

	<h3>Personal and Topic channels</h3>
	<p>There are two different types of channels. Personal channels and

	</table>
	<br />
	<h3>Channel Roles</h3>
	<p>Channel followers have have different roles. Most of the time
		you will not need them but roles can help keep the social aspect
		flowing.</p>
	<table class="table table-striped table-condensed">

			<th>Role</th>

	</table>
	<p>Channel owners can set the default role for new followers. For
		example: new followers will inherit the follower+post role.</p>

	<h2>Buddycloud System Architecture</h2>
	<br />
	<h3>Modular design</h3>
	<p>Buddycloud is is an ecosystem of servers bound together on a
		common messaging bus. Each server component runs independently and
		communications with it's peers locally or with remote sites that also
		run buddycloud.</p>
	<p>This component model also helps with scaling. When the time
		comes to grow, simply add a new component with the same address and
		requests are load balanced between them.</p>
	<br />
	<h3>Everything is modular / a component</h3>
	<p>We've designed Buddycloud to be extensible. Indeed even the
		Buddycloud-server is just another component that connects to a common
		communication bus. This modular design has particular advantages:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Easily add new features by just adding new modules</li>
		<li>Independently scale modules</li>
		<li>Security is compartmentalized</li>
		<li>Modules can be geographically distributed or hosted remotely</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	<h3>Authenticate against your existing database of users</h3>
	<p>Buddycloud has a number of ways to authenticate against your
		existing database of users.</p>
	<table class="table table-striped table-condensed">
		<tr>
			<th></th>
			<th>How it works</th>
			<th>Use case</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Buddycloud user database</td>
			<td>Use Buddycloud API for user authentication</td>
			<td>Starting fresh with a new set of users</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Parallel secret</td>
			<td>Your application generates a secret to be used with the
				buddycloud service</td>
			<td>New user base or existing user database</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Remote application call</td>
			<td>Authenticate users according to a pre-existing application
				API (for example https://your-app.com/auth)</td>
			<td>New user base or existing user database</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br />
	<h3>Connection handling</h3>
	<p>Applications have a number of different ways to connect to
		Buddycloud.</p>
